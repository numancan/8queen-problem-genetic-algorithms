# Solving 8 queens problem using genetic algorithm
The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. To solving this problem, I used genetic algorithm and implemented in Python.
